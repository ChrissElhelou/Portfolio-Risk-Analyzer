# Portfolio Risk Analyzer (VaR Calculator)
Project I did in a day or two because I was bored and had no school work.

  - Parametric (Normal Distribution)
  - Monte Carlo Simulation
- Real-time data fetching from Yahoo Finance via `yfinance`
- Portfolio return calculations
- Matplotlib visualizations of risk metrics
- Comprehensive unit tests (pytest)t

## Installation
